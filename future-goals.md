#Possible Future Improvements
- Have the character start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.
- Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
- Improve your game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. There are many helpful packages to assist with this, and you can really get creative with how you approach terminal games.
- Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved. This might be pretty difficult! You’ll essentially be creating a maze solver
